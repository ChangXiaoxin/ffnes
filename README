ffnes is a nes emulator.

Now there are a lot of nes emulators, but for me, I still want to write a completely new one. It's an interesting thing.

I have already spent a lot of time on study how nes hardware working and how to write a emulator. Now I'm ready to write code and do debugging.

I payed more attention to the quality of the code and portability. I think the code is clear and good for your reading, enjoy it.
