Introduction
------------

ffnes is a nes emulator.

Now there are a lot of nes emulators, but for me, I still want to write a completely new one. It's an interesting thing.

I have already spent a lot of time on study how nes hardware working and how to write a emulator. Now I'm ready to write code and do debugging.

I payed more attention to the quality of the code and portability. I think the code is clear and good for your reading, enjoy it.


How to compile
--------------
There is a vs2005 project for win32. You need install vs2005, then goto ffnes/vs2005 directory open ffnes.sln, and press run button directly, everything will be OK.

If you are using ubuntu or other linux distribution, you need install a mingw32 gcc compiler, then you could goto src directory, try make.
The target binary is for win32 due to mingw32. Currently code can't compile for linux platform, need do more porting work.


How to use
----------

Currently, ffemulator has no menu, can only operate by short cut key:

ctrl+o - open nes rom file
ctrl+d - open ffndb debugging dialog
ctrl+r - record game replay
ctrl+p - play game replay
